# 🚛 **Future-Proof Fleet Management: Data-Driven Safety & Efficiency**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
In the world of transportation, **safety and efficiency** are paramount. This project leverages **data analytics** to enhance fleet safety, identify high-risk drivers, and optimize truck selection. By analyzing incident patterns and fuel efficiency, we deliver actionable insights for a **safer, smarter** fleet.  

## ⚠ **Problem Statement**  
Fleet managers constantly battle safety risks, including **speeding, lane departures, and unsafe following distances**. Our goal is to:  
✅ **Identify** high-risk drivers based on incident history.  
✅ **Recommend** targeted safety interventions.  
✅ **Optimize** truck selection for better fuel efficiency and lower risk.  

## 📊 **Methodology**  
1️⃣ **Data Processing & Transformation** – Cleaned and structured fleet data to uncover key safety insights.  
2️⃣ **Risk Assessment** – Classified driver safety incidents and assigned risk scores.  
3️⃣ **Analysis & Visualization** –  
   - 🔎 **Event Distribution** – Identified patterns of high-risk behavior.  
   - ⛽ **MPG Analysis** – Compared truck models for fuel efficiency.  
   - 🚦 **Risk Rating** – Ranked trucks based on safety and efficiency.  
4️⃣ **Strategic Recommendations** – Implemented data-driven measures for fleet improvement.
